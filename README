InstrumentProcessor: A mocking kata
-----------------------------------

This project is the source of a coding kata focused on mocking. The idea is to 
spark a discussion on the benefits and/or drawbacks of mocked objects and 
mocking frameworks in unit tests. The original kata which this is based on was 
written for .NET, and it has been adapted for Java. I hope you find it 
interesting and engaging.
